Basic statistics:

- What is the total number of vaccinations administered in each country/region?
- How many new cases and deaths were reported in each country/region?
- What is the average number of vaccinations administered per day?

Comparative analysis:

- Which countries/regions have the highest and lowest vaccination rates?
- Can we group countries/regions based on their vaccination rates and analyze 
  the differences in infection rates among these groups?
-- How does the infection rate vary based on the vaccination status (fully vaccinated, partially vaccinated, unvaccinated) of   individuals?

Trend analysis:

-- How has the number of vaccinations changed over time in a specific country/region?
-- What is the daily average of new cases and deaths over a given period?
- Are there any seasonal patterns in infection rates?

Ranking and top-n analysis:

-- Which countries/regions have the highest number of fully vaccinated individuals?
-- What are the top countries/regions in terms of new cases or deaths?
-- Which vaccine types are most commonly used across countries/regions?

Joining and combining data:

-- Can we combine the vaccination and infection tables to analyze the relationship between vaccination rates and infection rates?
How do different regions within a country compare in terms of vaccination coverage and infection rates?
