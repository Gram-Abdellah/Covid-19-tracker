Data Manipulation and Cleaning:

-- Importing and loading data from CSV files or a SQLite database into Python using libraries like pandas or sqlite3.
-- Cleaning and preprocessing the data by handling missing values, transforming data types, and filtering relevant information.

Data Exploration and Visualization:

-- Exploring the dataset using descriptive statistics to gain insights into vaccination coverage, COVID-19 outcomes, and regional trends.
-- Creating meaningful visualizations such as line plots, bar charts, scatter plots, or heatmaps to illustrate patterns, trends, or correlations.

Statistical Analysis:

-- Calculating summary statistics such as mean, median, or standard deviation to understand the distribution of data.
-- Conducting correlation analysis to investigate relationships between variables.
-- Performing hypothesis testing or statistical modeling to assess the significance of findings.

Time Series Analysis:

-- Handling and manipulating time series data to analyze temporal trends in vaccination coverage and COVID-19 outcomes.
-- Applying techniques like rolling averages, time shifting, or decomposition to identify patterns and seasonality.

Data Aggregation and Grouping:

-- Grouping data by regions, countries, or time periods to calculate aggregate metrics or perform analysis on specific subsets of data.
-- Aggregating data using functions like sum, mean, or count to derive insights at different levels of granularity.

Presentation and Communication:

-- Presenting your analysis and findings in a clear and concise manner, using Jupyter Notebooks or other presentation tools.
-- Explaining the results of your analysis, highlighting key insights, and providing actionable recommendations based on the data.
